# Sudoku_Checker
Problem 6.14 from Elements of Programming Interviews

Check whether a 9X9 2D array representing a partilly completed Sudoku is valid. Specifically, check that no row, column, and 3X3 subarray contains duplicates. A 0-value in the 2D array indicates that entry is blank; every other entry is in [1, 9].
