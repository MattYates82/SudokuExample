Sudoku_Checker Requirements and Pseudocode

While we may eventually attempt to create a functioning Sudoku console game, the initial program should solve
the problem at hand.  The problem requires the ability to take a 9X9 array as parameter and determine whether
that array is valid according to the rules of Sudoku. The rules of the game are;

The classic Sudoku game involves a grid of 81 squares. The grid is divided into nine boxes (3X3 sub-array),
each containing nine squares. The rules of the game are simple: each of the nine blocks has to contain all the
numbers 1-9 within its squares. Each number can only appear once in a row, column or box.

The following is pseudocode that aims to display the primary functionality of the solution;

bool sudokuChecker(sudoku array)
{

	establish a boolean variable and set it to false

	loop through each row and determine that each number 1-9 appears a maximum of once each, if so set the bool variable
	to true, if not set it to false and return th variable which will cease the function

	loop through each column and determine that each number 1-9 appears a maximum of once each, if not set the bool variable
	to false and return th variable which will cease the function

	loop through each 3X3 subarray(box) and determine that each number 1-9 appears a maximum of once each, if not set the bool
	variable to false and return th variable which will cease the function


}
